pdill.dev
This is the repo for my portfolio website "pdill.dev". I will be using this webpage to showcase any projects that I build, and as a means to show my abilities as a developer while I work towards starting my career in web development. This is a work in progress, and I will be learning as I go. If anybody out there takes the time to read this, and has any advice for me, feel free to share by emailing me at paul@pdill.dev .
